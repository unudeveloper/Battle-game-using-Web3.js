# Blockchain Battle Arena
![Blockchain Battle Arena banner image](https://blockchain-battle-arena.netlify.app/banner_image_2.png )

Blockchain Battle Arena will be a cross-chain multiplayer battle game for NFTs. Any standard NFT on most Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible blockchains will be usable inside of the game. Your NFT characters will come to life as they don a mech suit and battle each other using a variety of weapons. The concept is loosely based on the Super Smash Brothers series of games, but with a more Sci Fi aesthetic.

The current demo is single player with a simple AI opponent and we only have one battle stage, but the underpinnings are there for 4 to 6 player multiplayer support, both local and over the internet. For local multiplayer, this will be achieved through gamepad input support in addition to the keyboard. Gamepads will be supported for online play as well, of course.
