# Blockchain Battle Arena

Blockchain Battle Arena will be a cross-chain multiplayer battle game for NFTs. Any standard NFT on most Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible blockchains will be usable inside of the game. Your NFT characters will come to life as they don a mech suit and battle each other using a variety of weapons. The concept is loosely based on the Super Smash Brothers series of games, but with a more Sci Fi aesthetic.

The current demo is single player with a simple AI opponent and we only have one battle stage, but the underpinnings are there for 4 to 6 player multiplayer support, both local and over the internet. For local multiplayer, this will be achieved through gamepad input support in addition to the keyboard. Gamepads will be supported for online play as well, of course.

### The future of NFTs

We would like to evolve the NFT standard to include the ability to mint and trade accessories for the base characters. In addition to accessories, we are also proposing evolving the NFT standard to include methods in the smart contracts that provide the base NFT image with a transparent background. These methods would unlock amazing interoperability with different games and dApps from the get-go, instead of collectors having to wait for the creators of their NFTs to launch a game or partner with other companies.

Some of these concepts are present in our demo here, but we hope to further refine them and build upon them in the future.
