# Blockchain Battle Arena

This is an NFT minting web app and battle game created for the OpenSea/Replit Hello NFT World hackathon. It explores some innovations for collectible NFTs beyond the standard pfp collections, allowing for composability and drop in use inside web3 games right off the bat.

TODO:
- Rewire up all the minting
- Move styles to scoped styled-components (to get rid of all the style clobbering)
- Swap local storage for moralis data attached to the user
- Get into the actual game functionality and clean up / refactor
